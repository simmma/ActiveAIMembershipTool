# AI Membership Checker
A _**very**_ quick Python script used to check if competitiors have Archery Ireland membership.

This prints out details of members who are missing membership or membership numbers by taking in:
- the csv of active AI memberships generated by AI's JustGo portal, and 
- a csv of competitiors using IANSEO's format

This might be converted into a different format in future to allow non-Python-knowers use this too

### Pre-requisits
- Python installation
- Access to AI's active membership report
- Knowledge of making a CSV UTF-8

## How-To

1. Get the list of AI members with active membership 
  
    Can be found via GoMembership -> Club Reports -> Customer Reports -> Events -> club membership list for competitions.

    By default, this script expects this file to be named `Club Membership list - for competitions.csv`

2. Make a new copy of the current *DU's Magical IANSEO Spreadsheet*, or whatever file you have that uses IANSEO's competitor upload format (sample of this can be found in this repo btw). 

    By default, this script expects this file to be named `DUCompetition.csv`

3. Run `python checker` on windows (... `./python checker` on Mac?)
